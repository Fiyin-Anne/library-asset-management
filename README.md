## Library asset management
A repository for a Library Asset Management API.

The Library Asset Management System API automates the process of borrowing books from the library. `Users` can view books available, borrow and return books. `Admin users` can authorize and monitor books borrowed and returned. This api is being developed with node JS, Mongodb and express JS.
